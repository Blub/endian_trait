# Contributing

If you find something you want added to this, you can let me know on GitHub,
Twitter, reddit, maybe the Rust IRC, under this name, or you can file an issue
or open a PR.

I think *this* crate is done; I need help on `endian_trait_derive` though. I
want to extend the custom derivation to cover enums with `#[repr(...)]`
annotations. I will document my issues more in the child crate.
