/*! Endian conversion trait

This trait declares methods that perform endian conversions on data types. For
the primitives, which are essentially atomic in structure, this conversion is
simple: flip all their bytes around. This conversion is also defined as inherent
methods on the integral primitives, so `Endian::from_be(n: i32)` is equivalent
to `i32::from_be(n: i32)`

The standard implementation of this trait is simply to call the methods on the
component members of a data type which are themselves `Endian`, until the call
stack bottoms out at one of Rust's primitives.

`char` is four bytes wide. Delegate to `u32`'s implementation and transmute.

codepoints, NOT integers, so not all values of `u32` are valid values of `char`.
The `to_` functions will emit potentially invalid `char` values, and this is to
be expected. The `from_` functions, however, will panic if they are about to
emit an invalid `char` pattern.
